name: Button
description: Use buttons to move though a transaction, aim to use only one button per page.
body: |
  Button text should be short and describe the action the button performs.

  [GOV.UK Elements has more information](https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/buttons/) on how buttons should be used.

  Note: We do not consume GOV.UK Elements directly due to the naming conventions being leaky,
  in time this component will be a wrapper for the [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) project's button component.

  Global button styles seen at `app/assets/stylesheets/helpers/_buttons.scss`
  should be considered deprecated with this component replacing any instances.

  govuk-* namespace replaced with pub-c-* otherwise we will conflict with [GOV.UK Frontend's namespace](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/components.md)

  This component is also [extended for use in govspeak](https://govuk-static.herokuapp.com/component-guide/govspeak/button).

  These instances of buttons are added by Content Designers, ideally this duplication would not exist but we currently don't have shared markup
  via our components within the generated [govspeak](https://github.com/alphagov/govspeak).
  (This is a challenge to the reader)
